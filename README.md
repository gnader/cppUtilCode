## Notes
The code is this repo is compiled from my personal projects and its features reflects the requirements of my projects.
I will keep updating it as my requirements evolves.
I have tested the code on with g++ on Windows and Linux but it should also work with clang.
Please let me know if you encounter any issue or bug.
