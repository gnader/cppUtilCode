Below is the list of available classes:

#### ArgumentManager

- **Code** : [argmgr.h](https://github.com/gnader/cppUtilCode/blob/master/src/argmgr.h)
- **Description** : a simple argument parser to manage of CLI arguments.
- **Usage** : This is a standalone header-only c++ file. There is no need to build it, just include it in your code and you are good to go.
- **Example** : [argmgr_example.h](https://github.com/gnader/cpp_utils/blob/master/examples/argmgr_example.cpp)

#### Singleton

- **Code** : [singleton.h](https://github.com/gnader/cppUtilCode/blob/master/src/singleton.h)
- **Description** : a minimalist generic singleton class.
- **Usage** : This is a standalone header-only c++ file. There is no need to build it, just include it in your code and you are good to go.

#### Timer

- **Code** : [timer.h](https://github.com/gnader/cppUtilCode/blob/master/src/timer.h)
- **Description** : a simple timer class based on std::chrono.
- **Usage** : This is a standalone header-only c++ file. There is no need to build it, just include it in your code and you are good to go.
- **Example** : [timer_example.h](https://github.com/gnader/cpp_utils/blob/master/examples/timer_example.cpp)

## Notes

The code is this repo is compiled from my personal projects and its features reflects the requirements of my projects.
I will keep updating it as my requirements evolves.
I have tested the code on with g++ on Windows and Linux but it should also work with clang.
Please let me know if you encounter any issue or bug.
